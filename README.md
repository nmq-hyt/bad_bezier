# bad_bezier
My partial answer to an exercise from Jeremy Kun's A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics.

I had originally gotten my code correct, implementing the bezier equation for a linear and quadratic bezier curve; but I mistakenly thought myself wrong, as I kept generating curves incorrectly - my tests were incorrect, but my code was correct.

As a result, I ended up making the same thing twice; these files are an implementation of bezier curves (linear, quadratic) using formula generation (graph.py) and interpolation (math_bezier.py).

I feel very stupid, but I wanted to answer this question for a while.

Ah, well.
