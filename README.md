# bad_bezier
My partial answer to an exercise from Jeremy Kun's A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics.

I had originally gotten my code correct, implementing the bezier equation for a linear and quadratic bezier curve; but I mistakenly thought myself wrong, as I kept generating curves that didn't look like "curves", even though the line generated passes through the interpolations, and the line generated corresponds  to actual bezier curves, drawn by hand, in other words, it is- my tests/intution were incorrect, but my code was correct.

As a result, I ended up making the same thing twice; these files are an implementation of bezier curves (linear, quadratic) using formula generation (graph.py) and interpolation (math_bezier.py).

I feel very stupid, but I wanted to answer this question for a while.

Ah, well.
